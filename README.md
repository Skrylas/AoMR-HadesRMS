Four reskinned and modified classic AoM maps with a Hades/Erebus theme:
- Nomad (Styx) - Classic Nomad, but on the River Styx there are no fish.
- Erebus Pits - A simple reskin of Mount Olympus.
- Erebus Pits (Nomad) - A reskin of Mount Olympus, but with the gameplay of Nomad, and the map features greater resource randomization.
- Vaults of Erebus - A slight twist on Acropolis, each player spawns with a Plenty Vault on their pleateau, speeding up gameplay slightly and encouraging more defensive gameplay.

My first attempt at some simple RMS editing.
